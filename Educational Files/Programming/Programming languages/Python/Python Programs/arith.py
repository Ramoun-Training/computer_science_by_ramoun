#Types of operators in python are:
"""
*arithmatic operator:+,-,/,*,%(module,modulo),**(exponent,power),//(floor division)
*comparison(relational) operators:==,<>,!=,<=,>=,<,>
*assignment operators:=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,//=,**=
*logical operators:and ,or,not
*bitwise operators:
	&:copies a bit if it exists in both operands
	|:copies a bit if it exists in either operands
	^:(xor)copies a bit if it is set in one operand but not both
	~:(binary ones)filpping bits
	/.............
*membership operators:
	in:evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the speceified sequence
	   and false otherwise
	not in:evaluates to False if it does not find a variable in the 
	   specefied sequence
*identity operators:
	is:evaluates to true if variables in both sides point to the same object
	is not:evaluates to false if variables in both sides doesn't point to
	the same object
