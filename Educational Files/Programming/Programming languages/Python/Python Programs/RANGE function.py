RANGE FUNCTION:
===============
When a range function is called with one argument,it produces
an object with values from 0 to that argument.

if it is called with two arguments,it produces values from the 
first to the number before the second.

range can have a third argument which determines the interval
of the sequence produced.This third argument must be an integer
