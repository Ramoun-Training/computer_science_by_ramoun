## Intro

**Git**: distributed version control system that has its own file structure where every file is stored in a seprate document and has a unique hash.

**GitHub**: repository hosting service.

> **Tip**: we can say that git is a persistent hash map that stores key-value pairs (key: hash, value: content of file).

> **Note**: GitHub is used primarily by distributed teams that work on same projects
