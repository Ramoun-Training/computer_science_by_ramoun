nested loops:
=============
while (not at the end of the email.txt file)  {outer loop
 //Blah-blah
 while (symbol != '@')  {//inner loop
 //Blah-blah-blah
 }
 //Blah-blah-blah-blah
}
NOTE:
Because one loop is inside the other, they’re called nested loops.  The old loop
(the symbol != '@'  loop) is the inner loop.  The new loop (the end-of-file
loop) is called the outer loop.

hasNext():
==========
while (diskScanner.hasNext()) {
 Execute the statements in Listing 14-1
}
NOTE:
The Scanner class’s hasNext method answers true or false to the following question:
    Does the email.txt file have anything to read in it (beyond what you’ve
    already read)?
