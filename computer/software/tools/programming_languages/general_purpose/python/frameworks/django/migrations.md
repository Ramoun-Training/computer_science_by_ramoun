`manage.py makemigrations` and `manage.py migrate` are both commands used in Django for managing database migrations, but they serve different purposes:

1. **`manage.py makemigrations`**:
   - This command is used to create new migration files based on the changes you have made to your models (such as adding new models, fields, or modifying existing ones) in your Django application.
   - When you run `makemigrations`, Django inspects the models in your app and creates a migration file (inside the `migrations` directory of your app) that contains the instructions for how to apply those changes to the database schema.
   - It doesn't actually apply the changes to the database; it just creates the migration files based on the changes detected in your models.

2. **`manage.py migrate`**:
   - This command is used to apply the migrations and sync the database schema with the changes you have defined in the migration files.
   - When you run `migrate`, Django looks at the unapplied migration files in your app's `migrations` directory and executes the SQL commands necessary to update the database schema according to those migrations.
   - This command is usually run after `makemigrations` to apply the changes to the database.

In summary, `makemigrations` is used to generate migration files based on changes in your models, while `migrate` is used to apply those migration files to the database and update the schema. You typically run `makemigrations` first to create the migration files, and then run `migrate` to apply those migrations to the database.
