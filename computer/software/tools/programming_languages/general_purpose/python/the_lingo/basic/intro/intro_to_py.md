# intro to python

python is a dynamically typed programming language (that means you don't to explicitly specify what type of data is gonna be assigned to a variable, python automatically figures that out by the type of input you put into the variable).

## Distribution

A distribution is just a version of Python that also come pre-packaged with additional useful libraries (e.g: anaconda distribution).
