NOTE:some of java's famous classes (String,Spring,Swing...etc)

=================================NOTE====================================
You never need to memorize the names or features of Java’s API classes.
Instead, you keep Java’s API documentation handy. When you need to know
about a class, you look it up in the documentation. If you need a certain class
often enough, you’ll remember its features. For classes that you don’t use
often, you always have the docs.

For tips on using Java’s API documentation, see my article “Making
Sense of Java’s API Documentation,” at www.dummies.com/extras/

visit some of the websites listed in Chapter 21.
