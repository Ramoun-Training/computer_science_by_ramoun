while statement:
================
repeating statements while certain condition remains true.

while the sum of the two dice isn't 7 and isn't 11
keep doing all the stuff in curly braces: {
}

*Each repetition of the statements in the loop is called an iteration of the loop.
*when condition is no longer true,the repeating of statements stops dead in its tracks.The computer marches on to the statements that come after the loop.

GOOD PROGRAMMING PRACITICE:
---------------------------
use flags instead of break; and continue; statements.

NOTE:
INFINITE LOOP:This kind of processing that doesn't stop -run forever- is called an infinite loop. The loop runs and runs until someone trips over the computerâ€™s extension cord.

NOTE:
to know the difference between (keyboard.next().charAt(0))and (keyboard.findWithinHorizon(".",0).charAt(0)) becomes clear inside the loop.

NOTE:
What the userName_Extractor program needs to do is (input->test->print).
OR  TODO:test -> print ->input

NOTE:
Disastrous or not, an unwanted blank space is the symptom of a logical flaw.
