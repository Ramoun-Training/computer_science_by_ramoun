compile-time errors(marked in red):
===================================
(known as a compiler error) is an error that prevents the computer from translating your code. 

to fix compile-time-errors:
---------------------------
you compare every character with original code.
You don't miss a single detail,including spelling,puctuation and uppercase versus lowercase.

Unhecked runtime exception:
===========================
an error occures in the middle of the run.
your instructions tell java to do something that can't be done,
So your program crashes and displays a nastylooking message(raise exception).
Eclipse’s editor doesn’t warn you about an unchecked runtime exception because, 
until you run the program, the computer can’t predict that the exception will occur.

Logic errors:
=============
You see no error markers in Eclipse’s editor, 
and when you run your code, the program runs to completion. 
But the answer isn’t correct.

Compile-time Warnings:
======================
A warning isn’t as severe as an error message.
just like saying:are you sure you want this code (the stuff that seems to serve no
purpose in your program)
Barry Burd's recommendation is this: Pay attention to warnings. 
But,if you can’t figure out why you’re getting a particular warning, 
don’t let the warning prevent you from moving forward.
