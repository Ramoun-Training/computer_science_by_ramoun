void:
=====
✓ The word void tells the computer that, when the display method is
  called, the display method doesn’t return anything to the place that called it.
✓ The word display is the method’s name.
  Every method must have a name. Otherwise, you don’t have a way to call the method.
✓ The parentheses contain all the things you’re going to pass to the
  method when you call it.
Packages:
=========
if you are going to use a class (defined in a different package),you have to provid it is path(package.class) or
use an import abbreviation.

import:
=======
when you use the * : that means you can use all the classes in the imported package.
i.e: import java.util.*; //all the classes in the java.util package (Scanner,Random,Locale....) can be used easily.

NOTE:
when you try to concatenate (char) type and (int,short,long,byte,float,double) type the char type gets converted to an int type.

REMEMBER:
Java doesn’t allow you to assign a char value to a string variable.

NOTE:The duality of (char) type needs more explaining.
NOTE:Using the double type to store an amount of money is generally a bad idea.
     The BigDecimal type is better.(need to use the java.math.BigDecimal import).

(Prameters or arguments)//
N.
*NOTE: A method call is an expression with a value.
*NOTE: If a method returns anything, then a call to the method is an expression with
       a value. That value can be printed, assigned to a variable, added to something
       else, or whatever. Anything you can do with any other kind of value, you can
       do with a method call.
NOTE: any variable that is not initialized have value of zero.
NOTE: need to know more about scopes.
