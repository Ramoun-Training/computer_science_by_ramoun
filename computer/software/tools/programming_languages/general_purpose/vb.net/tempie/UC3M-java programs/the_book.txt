chapter 4:
keywords:.....
2 keywords have no meaning in java programs
Those keywords — const and goto — are reserved
for non-use in Java.
The creators of Java
figure that, if you use either of the words const or goto in your code, you
should be told politely to move to the C++ programmers’ table

✓ main: The main starting point for execution in every Java program.
✓ String: A bunch of text; a row of characters, one after another.
✓ System: A canned program in the Java API. This program accesses some
features of your computer that are outside the direct control of the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM).
✓ out: The place where a text-based program displays its text. (For a
program running in Eclipse, the word out represents the Console view.
To read more about text-based programs, check the first several paragraphs of Chapter 3.)
✓ println: Display text on your computer screen.



A literal is a chunk of text that looks like whatever value it represents. In
Suzanne’s sentence (refer to Figure 4-2), “eh” is a literal because “eh” refers
to the word "eh."
