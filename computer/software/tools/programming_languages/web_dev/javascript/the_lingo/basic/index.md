# Javascript

A high level interpreted multiparadigm scripting language.

- **high level**: has a lot of abstraction (e.g: you don't have to deal with memory managment as in c+++/c).

- **Interpreted**: and that means your program is executed directly without running through a compiler.

- **JS** conforms to the specifcations of ECMAScript (note: there's other implementations of ECMAScript in other languages like ActionScript).

- **Multi-Paradigm**: means that you can write your code in many different paradigms (e.g: functional, OOP ...etc)(i.e: you are not forced to write in OOP like in **Java** for example).

- Runs on the client/browser as well as on the server (Node.js runtime environment (i.e: something like the **jre** for **java**)).
