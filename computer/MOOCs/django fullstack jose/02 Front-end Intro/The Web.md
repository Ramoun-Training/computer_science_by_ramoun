# Front End Intro

## What happens when you visit a website?

1. type the url (e.g: `https://facebook.com`).
2. the browser sends the request as a packet (which included the ip address of the website you want).
3. your isp will re-route the request to the appropriate server location (using the ip address as the guide).
4. once request reaches server, it sends you back the page you are asking for.
5. the server sends back the webpage split up into many packets.
6. the packets have insturctions on how to get back to you and how to reassamble once they reach to you.
