2. __Don't Give Up__   
(part of programming is figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it).

3. __Follow the 7 Step Process__    
(you should plan how to solve a problem before you start writing any code).

4. __Read Relevent Docs__   
(so you know what methods exist that can help you implement your solution & how to use them).

5. __Use the Live Coding Videos and Assignments__    
(this is a great opportunity to code alongside the instructors).

6. __Use the Practice Quizzes to Find and Fix Problems__.
