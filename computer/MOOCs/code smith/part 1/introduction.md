# overview of CSX

## How to become a software engineer

Becoming a software engineer is so much more than following along with coding tutorials. This is where every successful software engineer began but they became software engineers by _developing 5 core aspects of coding in parallel_:

1. __Analytical problem solving__ with code (taking a new problem with material you haven’t seen before and navigating through it).
1. __Technical communication__ (can I implement your approach just from your explanation).
1. Engineering __approach and best practices__ (Debugging, code structure, patience and reference to documentation, clean code ...).
1. __Non-technical communication__ (empathetic and thoughtful communication).
1. JavaScript __programming and computer science knowledge__.

If you focus your learning on simply following coding tutorials you will quickly feel a sense of plateauing. _To prevent yourself plateauing you have to develop in all these areas_ - that’s the purpose of CSX - to develop you as a complete software engineer.

In CSX we will begin the journey to:

- Understand __JavaScript and coding__ in a deeper way - the runtime, execution contexts, closures, higher order functions, the call stack and more.
- Become autonomous __problem solvers__ not just tutorial followers.
- Become sophisticated __communicators of our code__ through pair-programming. We will learn to code as part of a team.

With this you will be well on the journey to being a software engineer and to admission to the Codesmith program.

> **Note**: __problem-solving__ and __communication of your code__ is more important than your ‘knowledge’ of JavaScript.   

> **Note**: like art is about skill plus knowledge, coding about programming-language (tool) plus knowledge (problem solving..)

## prereqs

Once you have completed one of these prerequisites (js tuts online), you may want to complete others or start doing the resources’ more advanced parts.

However, at some point you will begin to feel this sense of plateauing - how do I move from following along tutorials to beginning to have the autonomy to tackle new challenges without the tutorial structure. What is the path? The answer is moving to harder open-ended challenges and a deeper understanding of JavaScript.

So what’s stopping everyone from doing this?

Becoming an autonomous problem solver with code is really hard. One of the reasons most of us rely on guided tutorials is that the next level involves hitting lots of intellectual, learning and even emotional blocks - it’s a struggle.

At the same time though, this is where you grow as a software engineer and move beyond following tutorials.

So how can we hope to push through these blocks?

By being part of a learning and building community - and above all - by __pair-programming__.

## Expectations

In CSX we expect you:

- To commit a certain number of hours per week minimum to working through CSX material. We recommend 10 per week if possible. __Developing a routine__ that lets you get flow on the material is essential to growing your coding skills.
- Attend at least 2 free coding workshops hosted by Codesmith to __pair-program__ either online or in person.
- Support and __contribute to the community__ and discussion as part of the CSX Slack channel.
- __Develop in all 5__ capacities that make an excellent software engineer that we described above.


You can expect of us:

- Push you to develop your problem-solving, communication and depth of JavaScript knowledge that will help prepare you for a bootcamp or (with additional work) for Codesmith’s admissions process.
- Support a workshop and pair-programming environment that is engaging and supportive.
- Develop and create new CSX challenges and update/fix where there are bugs (email at csx@codesmith.io with bugs)
